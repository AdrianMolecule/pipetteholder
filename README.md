# pipetteholder
a portable low cost pipetted holder

Often we need a portable pipette holder that can be taken to the field or to classes, demos etc.
A perfectly functional one can be built using recycled materials: A chocolate box for the case, some foam for padding and some3D printed hooks.
Here we document this build and provide all the necessary files.
