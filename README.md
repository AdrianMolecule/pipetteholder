## Portable Low-Cost Pipette Holder

A **portable pipette holder** is essential for fieldwork, classes, demos, or any situation where a stable and convenient place for storing pipettes is needed. This guide details how to build a functional, cost-effective pipette holder using **recycled materials** and **3D-printed parts**. With a little creativity, you can assemble a holder that meets your needs without breaking the bank.

### Materials Required:

- **Chocolate Box**: Repurposed as the case for the pipette holder.
- **Foam Padding**: Used for cushioning the pipettes and providing stability.
- **3D-Printed Hooks**: Custom-made hooks that will hold the pipettes securely in place.

### Instructions:

Quick Guide:

Take a Chocolate Box (Ferrero Rocher is a good choice)

Eat all the chocolates

3D Print the Pipette Hooks
Print the custom pipette hooks using a 3D printer.

Prepare an Elastic Loop
Use an elastic band to create a loop for added stability and organization. Undies are great donor.

Add Foam Padding
Place foam padding inside the box to cushion and secure the pipettes.

Test the Pipettes
Place your pipettes into the hooks and check the fit and stability.

Repeat ... Take a box of chocolate...

Long form
1. **Prepare the Chocolate Box**:
   - Find an empty chocolate box that will serve as the **case** for the pipette holder. The box should be large enough to comfortably fit your pipettes.
   - Ensure the box is clean and free of any packaging material.

2. **Prepare the Foam Padding**:
   - Cut foam into strips or pieces that will fit snugly inside the chocolate box.
   - The foam will be used to **cushion the pipettes** and help keep them in place.
   - Place the foam inside the box and trim it as necessary to ensure a good fit.

3. **3D-Print the Hooks**:
   - Download the provided **3D print files** for the hooks, which are designed to hold the pipettes securely.
   - Print the hooks using any standard 3D printer and suitable filament.
   - Once printed, check the hooks for fit and ensure they can hold the pipettes without being too tight or loose.

4. **Assemble the Pipette Holder**:
   - Attach the 3D-printed hooks to the inside of the chocolate box. You can either glue the hooks or use small screws to fasten them in place.
   - Arrange the foam padding around the hooks to create a secure environment for the pipettes.
   - Test the holder by placing your pipettes in the hooks to ensure they fit properly and remain stable.
